Instructor: Randy Valis

### Problem Statement:
We all know that we shouldn't reuse passwords across services but it's nearly impossible to remember a unique password for all of the services you use. Secrets Secured is the solution, store unique passwords for every service you log in too, as well as other sensitive secrets like SSN or Bank PIN.

### Features:
- Search
- Filtering
- Store, Update, and Delete secrets and passwords
- Copy secrets and passwords to clipboard
- Sign in from any supported android device and have access to all secrets/passwords
